Tips for formatting your quiz in markdown
separate paragraphs with an empty line
put list items on successive lines (no empty lines between items)
for bulleted lists, start the line with `- `
for numbered lists, start the line a number and a period. (The markdown formatter will number items sequentially: you'll get the same results if you individually number each line, or start every line with `1.`.)

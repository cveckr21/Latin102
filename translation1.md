C. Translation

When he [Hercules] came to King Dexamenus for the purpose of hospitality and deflowered the king's daughter, Deianira, Hercules wished to marry her. When Hercules went away, Eurytion, the centaur, asked for Dianira as his wife. Because her father was scared of the centaur, he promised that he would give her. At a particular time, he came with his brothers, the centaurs, to the wedding. Hercules stepped in and killed the centaur, and he took Deianira away.

Commentary/Response

Option A:

In Translation 3, we looked at sections 7-9 of Hyginus Chapter 30, and I found Hyginus' choice to omit a verb in section 9 for the last clause to be a very interesting choice. As a translator, I had to identify the understood verb of the clause, which was the verb *sum, esse, fui, futurus* meaning to be.

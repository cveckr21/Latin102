Commentary/Response

Option A:

In Translation 3, we looked at sections 7-9 of Hyginus Chapter 30, and I found Hyginus' choice to omit a verb in section 9 for the last clause to be a very interesting choice. As a translator, I had to identify the understood verb of the clause, which was the verb *sum, esse, fui, futurus* meaning to be. This example shows that the verb to be can be omitted in English and in this case Latin without losing grammaticality or changing meaning. I think that by Hyginus ommitting this verb, it adds color and dimension to the section. 

In Hyginus Chapter 30, section 3, we spent time in class working with the long and complex sentence that begins with *Haec* and ends with *moriebatur*. This sentence was very difficult at first glance due to the length; however, Hyginus creates such a description of the monster with its great force and its breath. I like how Hyginus kept this sentence long with lots of words because it creates a mental image that the reader can picture. The sentence and story is complemented well by this sentence because the sentence before and two after is on the more simple side, so it works very well with the passage to have a combination of simple sentences and then very detailed and colorful sections that enhance the meaning of the story.

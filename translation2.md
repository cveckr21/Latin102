Translation:

Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the great river whose name was Evinos, and asked the centaur Nessus, son of Ioxon and Nubes, to help. He carried Deianira across the river and he wished to rape her. When Hercules intervened to this place, and because Deianira begged with tears, he pierced Nessus with arrows. 

While he was dying and he knew that the arrows were soaked in the poison of the snake Lernaea, he knew how much strength the poison had and gave his own blood to Deianira and said that it was a love potion.

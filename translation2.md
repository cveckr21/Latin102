Grammatical questions:

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

>Cui goes to Evenus. The gender and number is masculine and singular. Cui is in the dative case because it indicates the person for whom an action happens or a quality exists.

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

>Transire is the present, active, infinitive of transeo. I placed it in the first independent clause to describe Deianira’s action of crossing the river.

3. sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

>Sublatam = accusative, feminine, singular, perfect, passive participle which comes from the verb fero, ferre, tuli, latus URN: urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n46406

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?

>Sagittas = arrows = accusative, plural, feminine ; Hyginus uses this case because it acts as the object in the preposition 

5. Identify the form of moriens.

>Moriens is the present participle but singular and accusative to describe what he was doing which is dying 

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?

>Felle = feminine, accusative plural and this case is used because it acts as the object of preposition 

7. Identify the form of tinctas.

>Tinctas = accusative, feminine, plural, perfect passive participle 

8. Identify the form of exceptum.

>Exceptum accusative, singular, neuter = - goes to suum (singular, neuter, accusative) 

9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

>Dying as I lay
 

Translation:

Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the great river whose name was Evinos, and asked the centaur Nessus, son of Ioxon and Nubes, to help. He carried Deianira across the river and he wished to rape her. When Hercules intervened to this place, and because Deianira begged with tears, he pierced Nessus with arrows. 

While he was dying and he knew that the arrows were soaked in the poison of the snake Lernaea, he knew how much strength the poison had and gave his own blood to Deianira and said that it was a love potion.

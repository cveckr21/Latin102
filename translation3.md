C. Literary commentary  **Nice observations!**

In sentence 8, vivum pairs with taurum; however, the two words are not near each other in the sentence. Hyginus adds a level of difficulty to the sentence when it comes to the translation because typically we see word pairs right next to each other. This word pair meaning “the living bull” adds more color the the sentence with providing the reader with a greater mental image of the actions occuring in this sentence.  

In sentence 9, Hyginus uses qui as a plural pronoun with the antecedent being Diomedes and the four horses. Using the pronoun, keeps the sentence from being bogged down with unnecessary words when a pronoun can be used instead. Qui translates to “who” and by using this pronoun it creates another clause to help breakdown the sentence into individual parts. 

Translation:

Hercules cleaned the manure of King Augeas’ stalls one day, the greater part with Jupiter as his helper; with the river having been sent forth, he washed away all the manure

Hercules led forth the living bull with whom Pasiphae had slept with from the island of Crete to Mycenes

He killed Diomedes, king of Thracia, and the four horses of him who were eating human flesh, with Abderus the slave; the names of the horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.
